## ðŸŽ®User Manual: How to start
- To begin, you have two options depending on your preference:
  -   For users who likes as little operations as possible, simply download the [main script](https://github.com/AdvPyS23/Lanex_language_model/blob/main/input_words_classes.py), along side with the data base generator of your choice: [Simplified Chinese](https://github.com/AdvPyS23/Lanex_language_model/blob/main/database_generator_chinese_simp.py), [Dutch](https://github.com/AdvPyS23/Lanex_language_model/blob/main/database_generator_dutch.py), [French](https://github.com/AdvPyS23/Lanex_language_model/blob/main/database_generator_french.py) or [German](https://github.com/AdvPyS23/Lanex_language_model/blob/main/database_generator_german.py). Put these files into one folder under WSL environment, and run the main script. In the user interface, you will have to choice to install the databases, and the appropriate font automatically (you may be asked to type in your root password for installing the font.)
  -  Alternatively, the recommended way is to copy/download the whole repository, and execute the [main script](https://github.com/AdvPyS23/Lanex_language_model/blob/main/input_words_classes.py). This way everything will be ready.
